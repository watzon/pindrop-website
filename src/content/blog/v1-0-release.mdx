We are thrilled to announce the release of **Pindrop v1.0**, a major milestone in our mission to bring private, high-performance AI dictation to macOS.

Built with pure Swift and SwiftUI, Pindrop leverages the power of Apple Silicon to deliver lightning-fast speech-to-text without sending a single byte of data to the cloud.

## Key Features

- **100% Offline & Private**: Powered by WhisperKit, everything runs locally on your Mac.
- **Global Hotkeys**: Trigger dictation from anywhere with a customizable shortcut (default: `F1`).
- **Multiple Models**: Choose from Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, or Large Whisper models to balance speed and accuracy.
- **Custom Dictionary**: Teach Pindrop your jargon, names, and acronyms.
- **Apple Silicon Optimized**: Uses the Neural Engine for 2-3x faster performance than generic Whisper implementations.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Pindrop is easy:

1. Download the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/watzon/pindrop/releases) page.
2. Unzip the application and move it to your `/Applications` folder.
3. Launch Pindrop and grant the necessary permissions (Accessibility and Microphone).
4. Press `F1` to start dictating!

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We have a roadmap packed with features, including:

- **Speaker Diarization**: Automatically distinguish between different speakers.
- **Translation**: Translate audio from one language to another in real-time.
- **Audio File Import**: Transcribe pre-recorded audio files.

Thank you for your support and feedback during our beta phase. We can't wait to hear what you think of v1.0!
