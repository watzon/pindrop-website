We're thrilled to announce **Pindrop v1.6.0**, featuring a complete overhaul of our AI enhancement capabilities. This release introduces **AI Enhancement 2.0** — a context-aware system that makes your transcriptions smarter, more accurate, and tailored to your specific needs.

## AI Enhancement 2.0

The AI enhancement system has been rebuilt from the ground up with three major architectural waves:

### Wave 1: Foundation
- New `AIEnhancementService` with improved state management
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Better integration with OpenAI-compatible APIs

### Wave 2: Context Capture
- **ContextCaptureService** — Automatically captures relevant context before transcription
- **Clipboard monitoring** — Include your recent copy/paste history for context
- **Screenshot capture** — Optional visual context for more accurate AI processing
- Smart privacy controls — You choose what context to share

### Wave 3: App Integration
- Full AppCoordinator integration for seamless workflow
- Real-time context injection during transcription
- Improved latency and reliability

## Preset Management System

One of the most requested features is here: **customizable AI enhancement presets**.

### Built-in Presets
We've included several professionally crafted presets to get you started:

- **General** — Balanced enhancement for everyday use
- **Professional Email** — Formal tone, proper grammar, business-appropriate
- **Casual Message** — Friendly, conversational tone
- **Technical Documentation** — Precise, structured, code-aware
- **Meeting Notes** — Action items, decisions, attendee tracking
- **Journal Entry** — Personal, reflective, narrative style
- **Social Media** — Engaging, concise, hashtag-friendly
- **Code Comments** — Developer-focused, documentation style

### Custom Presets
Create your own presets with:
- Custom system prompts
- Temperature and creativity controls
- Context source preferences (clipboard, screenshots, none)
- One-click switching from the AI settings panel

## Context Settings

New dedicated **Context** section in AI settings:

- **Enable context capture** — Toggle automatic context gathering
- **Clipboard history** — Choose how many recent clipboard items to include
- **Screenshot capture** — Enable/disable visual context (with privacy warning)
- **Context window** — Control how much context is sent to the AI

## UI Improvements

- **Preset picker** — Beautiful dropdown with descriptions and icons
- **Context indicators** — Visual feedback when context is being captured
- **Enhanced settings layout** — Better organization of AI-related options
- **Preset management sheet** — Edit, duplicate, and delete custom presets

## Privacy First

Context capture is **opt-in** and fully transparent:
- All context stays on your device until transcription
- Screenshot capture is disabled by default
- Clear visual indicators when context is active
- One-click disable from the menu bar

## What's Next

We're working on:
- **Preset sharing** — Export and import preset configurations
- **Smart presets** — AI-suggested presets based on your usage patterns
- **Advanced context** — Application-aware context (e.g., knowing you're in Safari vs Xcode)

## Upgrade Notes

v1.6.0 is fully backward compatible. Your existing AI enhancement settings are preserved, and the new preset system includes sensible defaults that match the previous behavior.
